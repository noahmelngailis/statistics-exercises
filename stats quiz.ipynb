A discrete variable has a set range of potential values for example hours in a day.  A variable can be functionally continuous and practically discrete.  A persons height is a continuous variable, if you had the tools to measure to infinitely small sizes, but your height in inches is a discrete variable, because there are a set of potential heights for somebody."
